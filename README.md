# Pending Response action üèÄ

On issue comment by a non-repo member (`member-associations`), remove the `pending-response-label`, if present.

Optionally, add a follow up label (`actionable-label`) to highlight that an action is required by the team.

## Usage

You can use the action by referencing the v1 branch:

```yaml
name: pending-response
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  issue_commented:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: siegerts/pending-response@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          pending-response-label: pending-response
```

### Using a follow up label

```yaml
name: pending-response
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  issue_commented:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: siegerts/pending-response@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          member-associations: "OWNER, MEMBER, COLLABORATOR"
          pending-response-label: pending-response
          actionable-label: follow-up
```
